Subject: [PATCH] FindSqlite: Use CMAKE_FLAGS the right way in try_compile().

This fixes f90774f1 ("Check whether Sqlite is compiled with
SQLITE_ENABLE_UNLOCK_NOTIFY"), so that SQLITE_INCLUDE_DIR is really
passed to the try_compile() call. So far, it was just a NOP and the
compilation only worked if sqlite3.h was in a directory the compiler
uses automatically.

try_compile()'s syntax is a bit complicated, and CMAKE_FLAGS expects a
series of arguments as if they had been passed to the command line, so
instead of "CMAKE_FLAGS INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES /some/dir" one needs to use
"CMAKE_FLAGS -DINCLUDE_DIRECTORIES:PATH=/some/dir".
