        Based on https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/src/a3d16c5f7443ec6e5e4d8d4791682b56130b41b5/pkg_resources.py?at=default

        Convert a version string to a chronologically-sortable key

         This is a rough cross between distutils' StrictVersion and LooseVersion;
         if you give it versions that would work with StrictVersion, then it behaves
         the same; otherwise it acts like a slightly-smarter LooseVersion. It is
         *possible* to create pathological version coding schemes that will fool
         this parser, but they should be very rare in practice.

         The returned value will be a tuple of strings.  Numeric portions of the
         version are padded to 8 digits so they will compare numerically, but
         without relying on how numbers compare relative to strings.  Dots are
         dropped, but dashes are retained.  Trailing zeros between alpha segments
         or dashes are suppressed, so that e.g. "2.4.0" is considered the same as
         "2.4". Alphanumeric parts are lower-cased.

         The algorithm assumes that strings like "-" and any alpha string that
         alphabetically follows "final"  represents a "patch level".  So, "2.4-1"
         is assumed to be a branch or patch of "2.4", and therefore "2.4.1" is
         considered newer than "2.4-1", which in turn is newer than "2.4".

         Strings like "a", "b", "c", "alpha", "beta", "candidate" and so on (that
         come before "final" alphabetically) are assumed to be pre-release versions,
         so that the version "2.4" is considered newer than "2.4a1".

         Finally, to handle miscellaneous cases, the strings "pre", "preview", and
         "rc" are treated as if they were "c", i.e. as though they were release
         candidates, and therefore are not as new as a version string that does not
         contain them, and "dev" is replaced with an '@' so that it sorts lower than
         than any other pre-release tag.
