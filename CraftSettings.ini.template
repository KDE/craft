## This is the settings file for use with powershell.
## Copy it to your craft/../etc and call ". .\kdeenv.ps1" or "kdeenv.bat" in your craft checkout.

[General]

## Here you set the ABI to be used.
## #platform-#abi-#compiler
## Valid combinations are:
## windows-msvc[2015, 2017]_[32, 64]-[cl, clang]
## windows-mingw_[32, 64]-[gcc, clang]
## linux-[32, 64]-[gcc, clang]
## macos-[32, 64]-clang
## freebsd-[32, 64]-clang
ABI = windows-msvc2015_64-cl
## This option should be set to False if you use the msvc 201X Express Edition 64bit compiler
## in all other cases, simply keep this option commented out
#Native=False

## This option can be used to enable a notification backend.
## As soon as the buildprocess of a project has finished a notification will be displayed.
## Possible Backends:
## Snore https://commits.kde.org/snorenotify. Snore supports multiple backends.
### To configure it call craft --snore-settings
### You might need to install snorenotify
Notify = Snore

## Speed up the merging of packages by using hard links

[Variables]
## Values here are usually set by craft and can be used for dynamic values
## To override the variables, uncomment them

## your own installation specify it here
#Msys = C:\msys

## Here you change the download directory.

[ShortPath]
## substitute pathes by drives
## This option is needed to avoid path limit problems in case of long base pathes
## and compiling big packages like qt
## If you disable it do _not_ use any paths longer than 6 letters in the
## directory settings

[Blueprints]
## The locations of the recipes
## You can specify additional external locations in ; seperated list

## If set this will override the default package type.
## Possible values are: SevenZipPackager,  MSIFragmentPackager,
##                      InnoSetupPackager, NullsoftInstallerPackager,
##                      CreateArchivePackager
#PackageType = SevenZipPackager

## Package the Source files too.

[CraftDebug]
## If you want to have verbose output, uncomment the following option
## and set it to positive integer for verbose output and to 0
## (or disable it) for normal output. Currently the highest verbosity level
## is 3 (equal to 'craft -v -v -v'). level -1 equals 'craft -q'
## Default is Verbose = 0
#Verbose = 1
